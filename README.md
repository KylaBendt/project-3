# Project 3
## Setup - git and pipenv
1.  Open an command prompt (Windows command line, terminal or Git Bash) and change to the directory you want the project to land in.  I think most of you have a folder called **bootcamp** in **desktop**.  So this will probably be **cd desktop** and then **cd bootcamp**.  

2.  After accepting the assignment, click on the **Clone or download** button and copy the link.  

3. At the command prompt, type in **git clone paste_the_link**

4. Change into the directory for the new project: **cd project_name**

5. Install the needed packages to set up the virtual environment: **pipenv install**

6. Run the virtual environment: **pipenv shell**

7. Launch Jupyter Lab:  **jupyter lab**

8. The command prompt will be tied up running the jupyter server.  Open a second command prompt so you can commit your changes using git. Again, navigate to the directory for your project.  

9. As you make progress, commit your changes along the way.  A rule of thumb for how often to commit is every 15 minutes or 15 lines of code.  Make your commit messages short and informative.  

* Tell what files have changed **git status**
* Add the files to be commited **git add filename**
* Commit the changes **git commit -m "commit message"**
* Push changes to github **git push**
